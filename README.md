# responsive-portfolio

## Description

In this homework, I updated my portfolio page from my responsive portfolio page to include images of my past homeworks.

## Functionality

* Each page has a basic Bootstrap nav bar, page header, and responsive layout.
* The index.html includes an image of me, a blurb about me, and sidebar with links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and a link to download my resume in PDF format.
* The portfolio.html page consists of screenshots of five projects that I have completed.
* Each image is also a link to the deployed web page of each project.
* The contact.html page contains several input fields and a submit button.
